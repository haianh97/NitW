	Gregg: do you need a reason?
	Mae: No, but I’d like one.
	Gregg: Fair.
Gregg: So we need the battery out of this car.
Mae: What for?
Gregg: That’s privileged info, Private.

	Gregg: You’ve been drafted.
	Mae: That’s, like, very unjust.
	Gregg: The world ain’t just, Private Borowski.
Mae: ok, but what if someone needs this car?
Gregg: I think it’s safe to say no one’s gonna miss it.
Mae: yeah. I guess it’s got a tree growing through it.
->So we’re just beating it until the hood pops open?
->Why aren’t you helping?
	Gregg: I’m carrying the battery all the way back!
	Gregg: Division of labor!
	Gregg: You get the fun part anyways.
