<<close>>
<<tell AngusConstellation:BirdPope MoveCamera>>
<<wait 1.2>>
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}testing out my psychic abilities in the pantry
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}made me really interested in both paranormal stuff and science.
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}and i joined a skeptic society on the internet
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}and that kinda ruined me on a lot of other supernatural bullshit.
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}and it gave me something to solve
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}something you could debunk or know...
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}i dunno. it saved me a little bit i guess.
<<close>>
<<tell AngusConstellation:Whale MoveCamera>>
<<wait 1.2>>
AngusAsWhale: cuz when someone does all that stuff to you

<<close>>
<<tell AngusConstellation:Bell MoveCamera>>
<<wait 1.2>>
MaeAsBell: So like...
MaeAsBell: I feel like if i'd been through that

MaeAsBell: do you believe in anything at all?
<<close>>
<<tell AngusConstellation:Whale MoveCamera>>
<<wait 1.2>>
AngusAsWhale: um well so like the constellations
AngusAsWhale: i don't believe there's a whale out there
AngusAsWhale: but i uh believe that the stars exist
AngusAsWhale: and that people put the whale there
<<close>>
<<tell AngusConstellation:BirdPope MoveCamera>>
<<wait 1.2>>
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}like i dunno
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}we're good at drawing lines through the spaces between stars
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}like we're pattern-finders, and we'll find patterns
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}and we like really put our hearts and minds into it
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}and even if we don't mean to.
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}so i believe in a universe that doesn't care
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}and people who do.
<<close>>
<<tell AngusConstellation:Cat MoveCamera>>
<<wait 1.2>>
MaeAsCat: pattern-finders.
MaeAsCat: i feel like a lot of people don't think they found god

<<close>>
<<tell AngusConstellation:Whale MoveCamera>>

        Angus: i mean like basically no sound. usually.
        Mae: that sounds really scary for some reason.
        Angus: well at least it means
        Angus: we're not gonna get rung to death by a bell.
    ->i think you die when it rings when it's looking at you
        Angus: well, crap
        Angus: it's high up enough it's kinda always looking at all of us, right?

Mae: it’s a whale
Mae: and it’s got like the world on its back
Angus: oh wow that's sad
    ->yeah
        Mae: kind of a lot of responsibility.
        Angus: did the whale consent to this???
        Mae: i think it just always was that way.
        Angus: ooooof.
    ->why?
        Angus: why does it have to carry the whole world?
        Angus: like, that's really unfair!
        Mae: ha ha yeah.
        Angus: that is legitimately upsetting.
Angus: you gotta wonder why people made these up.
Angus: i mean, like, these specifically.
Angus: who saw a whale and was like "needs to be carrying something"
    ->i mean whales are pretty big.
        Angus: but what's the whale swimming in?
        Mae: Space!
        Angus: I guess it's dumb to get mad at ancient people.
    ->they didn't know what the earth was.
        Angus: yeah but like
        Angus: i don't assume everything i don't understand is a whale.
        Mae: you could start!
