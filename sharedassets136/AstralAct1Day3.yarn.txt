ManOnFence: You are in the cemetery in Possum Springs, Pennsylvania.
ManOnFence: But surely you know that
ManOnFence: for you have come here to haunt me
ManOnFence: on such a lonely afternoon.

Mae:{align=middle,locator=MaeFenceTalk,width=2}And I’m not a ghost!
Mae:{align=middle,locator=MaeFenceTalk,width=2}And it’s night!

ManOnFence: Of Brian Rooke. He is like you now, ghost.
Mae:{align=middle,locator=MaeFenceTalk,width=2}What happened to him?
ManOnFence: Suffocated down the mines.
ManOnFence: Ed Yacynich tripped over him three weeks later.
ManOnFence: He was buried in coal dust.
Mae:{align=middle,locator=MaeFenceTalk,width=2}Well that’s pretty horrible!
ManOnFence: They pull him out of the ground
ManOnFence: they cleaned him up
ManOnFence: for awhile they looked at him
ManOnFence: and now they’re burying him again.
Mae:{align=middle,locator=MaeFenceTalk,width=2}Yeah I guess that’s kind of weird.
