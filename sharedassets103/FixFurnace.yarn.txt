Mae: So... got a gnome, a fishing pole, a badminton racket, and a fan.
Mae: Got two wheels and a... turny thing... with no wheel.
Mae: Probably just need to turn the turny thing...
-> ...to open up the heat pipes.
    Mae: Clanky’s probably got loads of heat but it can’t get out.
-> ...to turn up the fire.
    Mae: Clanky’s probably got a tiny fire going and could use some help.
    Mae: We’ve all been there! Poor Clanky.
Mae: to get Clanky all hot and bothered.
Mae: We will teach Clanky to love. 
Mae: I bet I could... hm...
