Mae: Oh ok. I'm not used to you using any other we's.
Mom: Believe it or not I've had several we's.

Mae: So what is this place?
Mom: Jenny's Field. Ever heard of it?
Mae: No? I don't think?
Mom: Back in the 30s
Mom: there was this woman and her daughter
Mom: walking here...
Mom: and the woman's daughter is in front of her
Mom: and then she's just gone. Like disappeared.
Mae: What happened?
Mom: Turns out there was a sinkhole that opened up
Mom: when a pillar collapsed in the mines in the hill.
Mae: Geez.
Mom: Yep. No one could see it because of the grass.
Mom: Her name was Jenny. This is Jenny's Field.
Mom: They never found her.
Mom: Just.
Mom: *wwssssp!*
Mom: Gone.
Mae: So... wait, why are we here?
Mom: What, you not up for a little risk taking?
Mae: ...

Mae: This is nice.
Mom: Used to be a lot more trees around up here.
Mom: They got cut down when they put in the towers.
Mae: I don't remember that.
Mom: You know, all kinds of things happened before you were born.
Mae: WHAT?!?!
Mom: Some minor parts of history took place, yes.

Mae: Ok... what is that?
Mom: For some reason before Unified pulled out
Mom: they brought this old lime furnace up on the mountain.
Mae: Why?
Mom: Who knows. Unified did a lot of things.
Mae: Looks like it's been here forever.
Mom: It's just sunk into the ground a lot.
Mae: Like Jenny!
Mom: But slower.
Mom: We used to climb up there.
Mae: Wanna try?
Mom: Ha ha ha. Oh sweetie.
Mom: I had you and also a lot of birthdays and donuts since then.
Mom: And not much climbing.

Mae: Good thing this chimney is sealed up here!
Mom: Ha ha ha. Yes, good thing.
Mom: What can you see up there?
Mom: It's been a while.
Mae: Uh...
    -> Possum Springs and most of the valley!
        Mom: What does it look like?
            -> A quilt?
                Mom: Well, it's a cozy valley.
            -> Like someone dumped out some blocks?
                Mom: Ha ha. Sounds about right.
    -> The highway!
        Mom: What does it look like?
            -> A river? But like made of concrete? With cars?
                Mom: [wave]Always rolling by, the river.[/wave]
                Mom: [wave]Oh,that river. It's big.[/wave]
                Mae: Are you... singing?
                Mom: Yeah, it's from a musical?
                Mom: Maybe?
                Mae: :) \o/
                Mae: [wave]IT IS NOOOOOOOOW!!!![/wave]
                Mom: Very nice.
            -> A snake? But like made of concrete? With cars?
                <<if $eels is 1>>
                    Mom: Heh heh. An eel maybe?
                    Mae: Oh my god yes. A massive eel.
                    Mom: Eels, honey.
                    Mae: Eels, mom.
                    Mae: What happened to the eel kid, by the way?
                    Mom: Someone finally noticed him down there
                    Mom: and emergency rescue pulled him out of the well.
                    Mom: And years later he wrote a book about it
                    Mom: and got rich!
                    Mae: Did the eels get a cut of it?
                    Mom: I don't think so.
                    Mae: That's a crime.
                    Mom: Won't anyone think of the poor eels?
                <<else>>
                    Mom: Big snake.
                    Mae: Big snake.
                    Mom: I got bit by a snake once up here, actually!
                    Mae: I haven't heard this story.
                    Mom: Yeah it was a copperhead. Jumped out from under a log.
                    Mom: My boyfriend at the time, Charlie, he was such a sweetie
                    Mom: tried to suck the snake poison from the bite on my leg.
                    Mae: Wow. That's a good boyfriend.
                    Mom: His mouth went numb and he suffered some tissue damage.
                    Mom: And I still had to go to the hospital.
                    Mae: Oh wow.
                    Mom: Don't suck poison from snakebites, sweetie.
                    Mae: Right.
                    Mom: It doesn't work.
                    Mae: Noted.
                <<endif>>
Mae: _o_ :|
Mom: I remember I couldn't tell if being up there
Mom: made everything feel bigger or smaller.
Mom: It's a weird feeling.
Mae: Yeah. I know that one.
Mom: I used to have a dream when I was your age.
Mom: Where I was in the big parking lot out by the tracks
Mom: and I'd start running, but there was always more parking lot.
Mae: Hm.
Mom: What do you think it meant?
Mae: I don't know. Feels weird to tell you what your dreams mean.
Mom: Why?
Mae: You're my mom.
Mom: ...
Mom: Fair.
Mae: Why did we come up here today?
Mom: Well I was hoping you'd fall into a sinkhole, obviously.
Mae: That didn't work out.
Mom: Drat.
Mom: Guess I'll just have to keep you.
