    Mae: I was playing this video game. You were like dating ghosts or something.
    Bea: ok
    Mae: and I was really into it. Played it like 24-7.
    Mae: until this one afternoon
    Mae: and suddenly, like, something broke.
    Bea: broke?
    Mae: it was just like... pixels.
    Mae: the characters onscreen… i felt like i knew them
    Mae: they weren't /people/ anymore. They were just shapes.
    Mae: and their lines were just things someone had written
    Mae: they never existed, they never had feelings
    Mae: they never would exist, either
    Mae: and it felt so /sad/
    Mae: like i’d just lost these real people
    Mae: and this whole thing we had, it was just… me. Alone.
    Mae: and like that realization like dumped out of the screen and into real life
    Mae: went outside and the tree out front,
    Mae: I looked at it every day, it was like a friend outside the window
    Mae: now it was just a thing... just a thing that was there
    Mae: growing and eating and just /being/ there
    Mae: like all the stuff i felt about the tree
    Mae: was just in my head
    Mae: and there was some guy walking by
    Mae: and he was just shapes
    Mae: just like this moving bulk of... stuff
    Mae: and I cried
    Mae: because nothing was there for me anymore
    Mae: it was all just stuff. Stuff in the universe
    Mae: just... dead
    Bea: wow... that's... huh
    Mae: And the next day was that softball game
    Mae: and Andy was the pitcher when I was up
    Mae: and he was just shapes too
    Mae: just lines someone wrote
    Mae: like nothing in there
    Mae: and I was so scared and angry and just... I dunno
    Mae: before I knew it I was on top of him
    Mae: smashing his face in with the bat
    Mae: just shapes
    Mae: red shapes all over the grass
    Bea: oh my god, mae.
    Bea: have you talked to anyone about this?
    Mae: after it happened they made me go to therapy
    Mae: with Dr Hank-
    Bea: oh gaaaaaaaawd. He’s the worst.
    Mae: and he made me start a journal
    Bea: a journal?
    Mae: yeah he kinda just said it would help to be able to get my thoughts down
    Bea: did it help?
    Mae: kinda? sorta?
    Mae: but since this whole thing happened, when I'm alone in a new place
    Mae: it's all shapes, like back at the softball game
    Mae: I was doing fine at college for a while
    Mae: but I couldn't make friends, I was just afraid of being outside or around people alone.
    Mae: And there was this statue of like the founder of something.
    Mae: a really shitty statue, like all rusty metal,
    Mae: and it was these shapes
    Mae: and he was pointing down at me
    Mae: and I was so... scared... I didn't leave my dorm room,
    Mae: I either didn't eat or I ate entire pizzas at once
    Mae: I downed cough syrup just to sleep all the time
    Mae: and finally I got up the courage to leave.
    Mae: and I came home. Where everything was fine.
    Mae: where I knew everyone, and it wasn't just... dead shapes.
    Mae: watching me.
    Bea: Geez.
    Mae: something broke. In my head. In my life.
    Bea: i don’t mean to be like… whatever, but
    Bea: it sounds like you’re suffering from some serious stuff
    Bea: and like, I can help you find some help for it?
    Mae: Dr Hank already tried!
    Bea: I think Dr Hank should stick to family medicine and dentistry
    Bea: and the half dozen other things he does
    Bea: and maybe leave the mental health services to someone else.
    Bea: like there are such things as depression and anxiety and like
    Bea: i dunno… what you’re going through, it exists.
    Mae: I… I thought when I came home…
    Mae: i just-
    Mae: i felt so safe here
    Mae: and everything made sense for a few days
    Mae: and then all this.
    Mae: and… and… and…
    Bea: shhhhhhh
    Bea: it’s gonna be okay
    Bea: we’ll figure this out
    Mae: i’m so scared

    Mae: what he’d done
    Gregg: he was probably an asshole
    Mae: no, dude. I didn’t know him. Neither did you.
    Gregg: well then you had to go the therapy
    Mae: yeah Dr Hank and his journalling. 
    Gregg: doctor hank’s messed up one of my tooth fillings.
    Mae: yeah he’s not good at what he does.
    Mae: which i guess is understandable because he does like everything.
    Gregg: i meant to ask you- did that journal shit… did it actually work?
    Mae: kinda? Sorta?
    Mae: it helps me… like… grab onto things. And keep them in one place.
    Gregg: whoa.
    Mae: but since that whole thing happened back then
