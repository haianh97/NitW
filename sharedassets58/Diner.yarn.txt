Mae: Oh.
Gregg: You should come visit when we get settled in!
    ->Why Bright Harbor?
    ->Isn't Bright Harbor like really expensive?
        Gregg: Not if you live in a terrible neighborhood!
Gregg: Oh Mae it's SO cool.
Gregg: We visited in the summer
Gregg: There's like record stores and weird bars
Gregg: and everyone's cool and like... free?

Gregg: And it didn't even hurt!
Mae: You have a tattoo.
Mae: You're moving to Bright Harbor.
Gregg: Yeah!
Mae: Oh.
// We need a variable to say I know about Bright Harbor and the tattoo so we don't repeat this later.
// ^ we can use $did_gregg_friendship_quest_1 to check this
Gregg: What's wrong?
Mae: Nothing!
Gregg: How long do you think you're staying in town?
    -> Um. I don't know.
        Gregg: I'll help you pick somewhere out.
    -> Not long. Gonna move too.
        Gregg: Ooh where to?

                Gregg: Heat and tornadoes and sweet tea!
                Gregg: Ooh we can come visit in the winter!
Mae: Yeah.
Gregg: It was really great hanging with you tonight.
Gregg: I've been really boring lately.
Gregg: Haven't done a crime in... a long time.
Mae: Why?
Gregg: Angus. The plan. Can't go to Bright Harbor if I get caught or fired.
Mae: You're all adult now.
Gregg: I'm bonafide.
Mae: I'm gonna go I think.
Gregg: Good call. We need to de-glue.
Mae: I think we stunk up the diner.
Gregg: Eh. Wouldn't be the first time.
Mae: =_= :)
Mae: I missed you.

Mae: too bad you didn't snap your spine.
Gregg: too bad your arms didn't get ripped off.
Mae: too bad you weren't horribly disfigured.
Gregg: too bad you didn't fall and break your teeth on a stair.
Mae: too bad you didn't get trapped under the box
Gregg: too-
Mae: not finished
Mae: and then burned alive in a building fire.
Gregg: too bad you didn't crawl into a vent
Gregg: to escape the fire
Gregg: and get cooked.
Mae: aaah. good times.
Mae: I still smell gluuuuuuuuuuuuue.
Gregg: Think about something else.
Mae: I can't. I think I'm high from the glue.
Gregg: Think about pierogis.
Gregg: They have pierogis when you were at school?
Mae: This one church in town would sell them during whatever holiday.
Gregg: Feast Of The Perpetual Pierogi.
Mae: Yo dude.
Gregg: What?
Mae: Open your mouth.
Gregg: Why?
Mae: Trust me.
