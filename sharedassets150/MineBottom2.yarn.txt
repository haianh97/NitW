Eide: there they are! They’re right there!
Eide: I'm gonna kill them!
HeadMiner: Eide, you'll do no such thing.
HeadMiner: It's out of your hands now.
Eide: he... shot... me!
HeadMiner: Then I’d say we're even.
HeadMiner: Little girl got shot at the other night.
Miner1: Yeah. Sorry about that.
Mae: You're... apologizing?
Miner1: It was a bad call. I am sorry.
Mae: Uh. It's ok?
Mae: It didn’t actually hit me, so-
Mae: Wait. What the- Who are you?
HeadMiner: Buncha of old boys doing their damnedest
HeadMiner: to protect their own and their neighbors.
Mae: Th-... then. why are you trying to kill me?
Miner2: Kill you?!
Miner1: Nobody's gonna kill you!
HeadMiner: All of you are part of this town.
HeadMiner: by family relation or just by being hard workers.
Miner2: Contributors!
Mae: Um. ok.
Mae: so we could just leave?
HeadMiner: Well, *he* brought you down here for a reason
HeadMiner: and he’s not gonna let you leave until he’s had his say.
Mae: Well *he’s* already got an arrow through the shoulder.
Mae: I don’t think he’s gonna be having much say in whatever.
HeadMiner: …
Miner1: ...
HeadMiner: Wait. So you think that Eide-
Mae: He kidnapped that kid at Harfest!
Mae: He’s… been in my head somehow!
Mae: I'm always tired! Constant headaches!
Mae: He's been following me... following all of us!
Mae: He-
HeadMiner: Oh, little girl. 
HeadMiner: You don’t know what this is, do you?
<<playMusic boss_conversation 6>>
Mae: What?
//miner lights another lantern and we can see the hole now. Camera backs up a bit to show more blackness around.
//Camera does some light blur/swimmy stuff for a second.//

Mae: i’ve seen this
Mae: or I’ve… I’ve felt it…
HeadMiner: Was Ed Skudder and Jim Dorney who found it.
HeadMiner: 20 years back or so.
HeadMiner: After the west mine closed out past Briddle
HeadMiner: Vest Schumacher. Last supervisor.
HeadMiner: was out there when the company locked off the entrance
HeadMiner: carved his initials and date in the door.
HeadMiner: Then you got this mine, the Old One.
HeadMiner: not even a proper mine. Big hole. Copper.
HeadMiner: Abandoned, shoot, long before any of us were born.
HeadMiner: too close to water.
HeadMiner: And that water was poison
HeadMiner: when the first settlers came out here.
HeadMiner: that old spring used to be right above where we’re standin’.
HeadMiner: but that water dried up.
HeadMiner: 1992 or so some men from west mine
HeadMiner: come back up here to try bootleggin,
HeadMiner: practically built a new elevator, got the main tunnel cleared
HeadMiner: never found no coal, just dug deeper n' deeper
HeadMiner: til Ed busts through that wall and finds this place
HeadMiner: and Jim walks right into that hole
HeadMiner: and never hits bottom.
HeadMiner: Ed calls down to Jim
HeadMiner: Jim don’t answer
HeadMiner: but someone else does.
HeadMiner: I know you heard that voice, girl.
HeadMiner: In dreams and in waking times.
HeadMiner: ‘swhat brought you down here. 
	-> what... what is it?
		HeadMiner: black goat
		HeadMiner: not even black like the color
		HeadMiner: black like the space between the stars
		HeadMiner: he’s down there, in that hole
		HeadMiner: looking up at us right now
		HeadMiner: he don’t talk to ya
		HeadMiner: he... sings...
		Mae: why would you just do something a hole in a cave told you to?
	-> so what does this have to do with you, or me, or anyone?
HeadMiner: you got to understand
HeadMiner: in those days it was the end of the world
HeadMiner: jobs gone. Our kids were leaving.
HeadMiner: government didn’t care, only wanted our votes.
HeadMiner: just puttin in more regulations, sendin our jobs overseas,
HeadMiner: spendin our taxes on lazy people 'n immigrants
HeadMiner: while we worked ourselves to death.
Bea: ugh here we go.
Bea: goddamn i hate this crap.
Bea: you old dipshits.
HeadMiner: you finished?
<<wait 2>>
Bea: yeah sure.
HeadMiner: we prayed and prayed up at the church,
HeadMiner: but when Ed Skudder came back down here and listened
HeadMiner: he got answers back.
	-> oh god… i think i know...
		HeadMiner: yeah he’s already in there singin to ya, right?
		Mae: I… I…
	-> answers?
HeadMiner: Ed explained it to a few folks, and they didn’t believe it
HeadMiner: but he was persuasive
HeadMiner: he had the glimmer.
Mae: "the glimmer?"
    Miner2: ones 'e takes a shining to
    Miner2: it rubs off on ya.
    Miner2: you can do things.
    HeadMiner: I never seen it
    HeadMiner: but they said Ed could walk through walls.
    Mae: ok.
HeadMiner: after Ed talked us into all this,
HeadMiner: after that first time, after we picked one out
HeadMiner: well...
HeadMiner: not only was the town holdin' stable
HeadMiner: but it was almost like we were getting younger, and money came too
HeadMiner: still a few of us left from back then
    -> “Picked”?
        HeadMiner: first one was Tom Turner, who believe you me was a bastard
        HeadMiner: just pure trash
        HeadMiner: we got him down here
        HeadMiner: and in the hole he went.
        HeadMiner: the next week, flowers bloomin’ all over the hills
	-> “First time?”
		HeadMiner: First one into the hole by our own hands.
		HeadMiner: We own up to what we do. I was there.
		Miner2: I was too.
Bea: You throw them in the hole?
Mae: ...
Mae: they’re... feeding him...
HeadMiner: he's hungry like you wouldn't believe.
HeadMiner: every few months or so he starts singin’
HeadMiner: and it’s someone’s turn to find someone.
    ->was that what you were doing the other night?
        Miner1: No.
        HeadMiner: What happened the other night was a shame.
        HeadMiner: One of our number broke the rules.
        HeadMiner: an' had to pay up.
        HeadMiner: that was a hard thing to do
    ->...
Mae: i think i’m gonna be sick...
HeadMiner: we never pick noone who’s gonna be missed
HeadMiner: that’s a solid rule.
HeadMiner: Drifters, drunks, and delinquents.
Mae: you’ve been… oh god… oh no...
	-> How many people have died down here???
		HeadMiner: oh, I’d say…
		Miner1: 3 dozen. Give or take.
		Miner2: 39.
		Miner2: am I the only one keeping steady count?
		HeadMiner: I do now. Early on I think we all wanted to forget.
        Miner1: i still got a feelin' heart. it still hurts.
        Miner2: yeah that dirtbag kid from the spring...
        Gregg: C...c...casey?
	-> Casey? 
HeadMiner: The Hartley kid?
HeadMiner: all he was gonna contribute to society
HeadMiner: 'cept a buncha kids growin up with no dad
HeadMiner: was a rap sheet a mile long
HeadMiner: before whatever sad end he’d wind up at.
HeadMiner: we did him a FAVOR.
Gregg: You... k-killed... Casey?
Angus: oh my god.
HeadMiner: we don’t use that word.
HeadMiner: you know he was taking up business with his cousin, right?
HeadMiner: you know what happened to his cousin?
HeadMiner: burned alive when his little trailer lab exploded
HeadMiner: they had to wear hazmat suits when they cleaned him up
HeadMiner: that’s where Casey was headed.
Gregg: You killed Casey.
HeadMiner: and you want to act like we didn’t do him and this whole town a favor?
Mae: oh god… Casey’s been down here the whole time.
Mae: his parents put up posters!
HeadMiner: maybe they shoulda cared more about him before it came to this.

HeadMiner: but we can change that.

Mae: why are you telling us all this?
HeadMiner: Because we’re getting old
HeadMiner: and even with the fringe benefit of good health
HeadMiner: we need new blood
HeadMiner: to carry this on when we’re gone.
Bea: Really? You’re like, pitching us on this?
Bea: were any of you even miners back in the day?
Bea: any of you hurting now? financially, like?
Bea: or is this just some big costume party murder club
Bea: for someone's shitty boss who's afraid of dying?
<<wait 2>>
HeadMiner: that don't matter.
Bea: *snort*
Bea: it does.
Angus: this is real bad.
Gregg: this is insane.
	-> why should we help you?
	-> why shouldn’t we just call the cops?
		HeadMiner: And say...what?
		HeadMiner: you saw some men you can’t identify
        HeadMiner: in an abandoned mine behind a locked gate
		HeadMiner: and an elevator that won’t run?
		HeadMiner: that you saw a… hole?
		Mae: ok fine. Why should we help you?
HeadMiner: because if no one is here to do this
HeadMiner: you remember that flood a few years back?
HeadMiner: you remember the blizzard of 2010?
HeadMiner: that’s what happens.
HeadMiner: and beyond that
HeadMiner: the jobs never come back. The kids never come back.
HeadMiner: everything crumbles. Possum Springs bleeds to death.
HeadMiner: and soon we’ll all be dead
HeadMiner: and this town will just be fields and trees.
Mae: I’ve... seen it.
HeadMiner: I know you have.
<<wait 3>>
HeadMiner: I’ll understand if you need some time to think it over.
Bea: so we can leave?
HeadMiner: no one’s gonna stop you.
HeadMiner: but understand that you don’t know who we are
HeadMiner: out there
HeadMiner: but we know who you all are
Eide: ain’t fair they get to leave and I probably got permanent damage
HeadMiner: shut it, eide!
Eide: you don’t know a thing about what he wants! What he is!
HeadMiner: eide i swear to god
Bea: let’s go
Gregg: yeah let's seriously get out of here
HeadMiner: son, you leave that crossbow.
Gregg: what? why?
HeadMiner: well, i could bullshit you
HeadMiner: but the truth is i just don't trust you.
Gregg: fine whatever. It's a piece of shit anyway.
HeadMiner: heh heh.
Mae: I... I can’t move you guys
Angus: I’ll carry you.
