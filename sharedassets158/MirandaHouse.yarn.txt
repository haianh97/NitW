Miranda: Ever since Gene passed, I just can’t abide that thumping...
Bea: Understandable.
Miranda: Gene was such a darling man…

Bea: wait for it.
Miranda: ...I’ll never forgive them for taking him away…

Miranda: ...I looked it up on the internet...
Miranda: ...he didn’t smell or nothing!
Bea: ...wait… for… it....

Bea: There it is.
Mae: holy god

Bea: It’s a crime.
Mae: Yeah a crime was definitely committed alright…
Miranda: They just couldn’t abide not being able to tax him anymore, that’s what it was.

Mae: Busted.
Bea: Or something.
Bea: Ok, down we go!
