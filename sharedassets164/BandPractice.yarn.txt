		Gregg: oh yeah i used to do that with pennies
		Gregg: i guess i needed to think bigger
		Mae: So like when Germ’s grandma told my fortune
		Mae: i couldn’t shake this feeling that it was like something else i’d seen
		Mae: and i realized what it was last night when we were down there
		Mae: like it all felt like i was getting squashed on the tracks
		Mae: and i was getting all deformed and weird and shit
		Gregg: huh
		Gregg: that’s intense
		Mae: like when they did that mountaintop mining south of here
		Gregg: ugh.
		Mae: i know right

		Mae: like when the mills and mine shut down
		Mae: but those assholes down in the tunnels thought they could bring it back

		Mae: yeah it’s awesome.
		Mae: it also made me think like
		Mae: if they were alive when it happened
		Bea: god, that’s grim
		Mae: if they were just destroyed and crushed by this massive unknowable thing
		Mae: and crammed into being one thing
		Mae: they’re like a new monster.
		Bea: twice the monster, even.
		<<if $did_bea_friendship_quest_1>>

			Bea: i think you actually injured a few of those people
			Mae: eh.
			Mae: anyway
		<<endif>>
		Mae: but like look at where we live
		Mae: big giant things rolled over this place
		Mae: and i don’t know if it made us all stronger
		Mae: or just made some monsters
		Bea: i… think it did both.
		Bea: like anything traumatic on that scale does both?
		Bea: but as much as i hate this shithole sometimes
		Bea: it’s home.
		Mae: Remember when Mrs Crangler taught us to squaredance in girl scouts?
		Bea: ha ha yeah. Geez. she had that stick
		Mae: yeah she’d hit the ground to the beat
		Bea: Mrs Crangler was serious about squaredancing.
		Mae: she died recently i guess.
		Bea: yeah. She was extremely old though.
		Mae: squaredancing was weird
		Mae: all of us just like jumbled up
		Mae: trying to dance, trying not to trip over each other
		Bea: Mr Crangler is dead, but the squaredance lives on.
		Mae: i wonder if Lori knows how to squaredance.
		Mae: we should teach her?
		Bea: oh, am i being drafted into this makeshift sisterhood?
		Mae: sisterhood of squaredancing monsters
		Bea: we’ll rule the floor at the state farm show
		Mae: we’ll rule any floor we lay our eyes on.

		Bea: holy crap.
		Mae: she came right back. It’s ok.
		Bea: what did she say?
		Mae: basically what happened last night
		Mae: or part of it.
		Bea: you know, if you go back in regional history and stuff
		Bea: there’s like stories about witches and stuff
		Mae: you believe in witches?
		Bea: oh geez don’t ask me what i believe in today
		Bea: but yeah. It’s in the history books.
		Mae: so you’re telling me she was actually psychic
		Bea: how would that even work?
		Bea: does that mean the future is just set?
		Mae: maybe it’s the future depending on what choices we make
		Bea: but if the choices haven’t been made yet that’s part of the future
		Bea: so it should be part of the… something...
		Bea: uuuugh. My brain.
		Mae: no, that’s a good point. Didn’t think about that.
		Mae: well anyway. What she said was scary but
		Mae: it was nice to feel like there was some sort of order to all of this.

		Mae: and there’s this star they can’t see until they’re dead
		Bea: yeah. The ghost star.
		Mae: and if you saw a reflection of the ghost star it’d be like a pentagram.
		Bea: that is true.
		Mae: i dunno. There’s this other kid, Lori Myers.
		Mae: we were hanging out by the tracks
		Bea: so you’re just hanging out with teenagers all over the place.

		Mae: and they become like these cool little monsters.
		Bea: oh that’s cool.

		Bea: alchemy.
		Mae: yeah. It was like alkamee. She was like doing magic.
		Bea: so you’re saying you’ve met like 4 witches.
		Mae: not real ones but
		Mae: i don’t know what i’m getting at.
		Mae: when i felt like everything was over, like there was no hope
		Mae: remembering like… ghost stars and adina and teen witches
		Mae: and lori making monsters out of toy people and real trains
		Mae: just suddenly felt like life was happening
		Mae: and teens were doing weird magic.
		Mae: so things couldn’t be that hopeless.
		Bea: this is like those inspirational stories religious people put in books
		Bea: and like old people read them
		Bea: about how angels like stopped a car from hitting them

		Bea: who was she?
		Mae: just an old lady getting involved in all this weirdness. For some reason.
		Bea: uh huh.
		Mae: ok so also there’s this kid, Lori, that I’ve been hanging out with?
		Bea: “kid”?
		Mae: like 15 or something.
		Bea: so you’re just hanging with children and the elderly these days?
		Mae: anyway.
		Mae: Lori lives over by the tracks
		Mae: and i don’t think her home life is great.
		Mae: at all.
		Mae: but she’s awesome. Loves horror movies.
		Mae: makes these little monsters by putting little metal dudes on the tracks
		Bea: oh and they get all squished and stretched? That’s rad.
		Mae: yeah see? Cool kid.
		Mae: then she’ll take like two of them and squash ‘em together.
		Bea: doublemonster.
		Mae: i feel like i’m like a kind of a older sister to her when we hang out?
		Mae: My grandma died a while back
		Mae: and germ’s grandma was trying to grandma me.
		Mae: and you’re like my… sister? Cousin?
		Bea: the crazy uncle.
		Mae: ok whatever.

		Bea: ok that’s spooky. Was he in your house?
		Mae: no, he was like looking out the window at the hospital.
		Mae: but i think i get what he meant.

		<<if $did_bea_investigation_quest>>

		<<if $did_angus_investigation_quest>>
			Mae: Angus would say it was pattern-seeking

		<<endif>>
		Mae: when i saw it it reminded me of something 
		Mae: didn’t really register until this morning-
		Mae: remember Adina and the Frozen lake?
		Bea: the folk tale? I think it’s called Adina and the Forest God.
		Mae: whatever. Remember how there was like a dead astronomer
		Mae: who was like a reflection in the ice?
		Bea: yeah. Uh. looking for a star you could only see when you’re dead.
		Bea: the Ghost Star.
		Bea: my mom had a ghost star tattoo.
		Mae: anyway, like if you’re looking at a reflection of a star from below
		Mae: it’s gonna look kinda like a pentagram
		Bea: that’s… true?
		Mae: woke up this morning and was like oh wow
		Mae: i feel like i  found my ghost star
		Mae: and then lived.
		Bea: and this is because of teen witches?
		Mae: ok see i thought that was dumb BUT
		Mae: I met Germ’s grandma. 
		Bea: WHAT?????
		Mae: yeah I went to his house!
		Bea: What’s it like????
		Mae: um it’s nice?
		Mae: double wide with a finished basement.
		Mae: got a trampoline.
		Bea: ugh. Those things make me sick.
		Mae: anyway his grandma told my fortune and then kinda died for a minute?
		Bea: holy shit.
		Bea: what was your fortune?
		Mae: oh it was vague and only half right but it basically what happened last night?
		Mae: and she seemed to know about all the weird dream stuff too.
		Bea: wow.
		Mae: yeah see? So like I’m thinking, maybe *she’s* a witch too.
		Mae: not like an actual witch. The teens aren’t *real* witches either.
		Bea: so….
		Mae: there’s this other kid, Lori M. we’ve been hanging out.
		Bea: you just hanging with teens all over the place these days?
		Mae: hush. I’m like a role model.
		Bea: oh well then.
		Mae: Lori does this thing where she puts little metal dudes on the train tracks.
		Bea: oooh! And the train squishes them? That’s so cool.
		Mae: yeah she’s great.
		Mae: i dunno. Maybe this is just me not being a kid anymore
		Mae: but watching her do that. Open her little bag
		Mae: and pull out these things
		Mae: and then like using actual trains
		Mae: making little monsters.
		Mae: i came to the only logical conclusion.
		Mae: Witch.
		Bea: Well gee Mae you seem to be just swimming in witches.
		Mae: Hey listen you could be one too.
		Bea: oh god i wish. I have some hexes to hand out.
		Mae: and I mean obviously i count as a witch. I’m like spooky magic as eff.
		Bea: of course
		Mae: i dunno. Last night, today… 
		Mae: everything is extremely bad here right now.
		Mae: everything is bad in the world.
		Bea: guys last night,
		Bea: they’re like ghosts in an old mansion
		Bea: don’t know they’re dead
		Bea: just stalking around killing whoever moves in.
		Mae: like granddad said. It’s haunted.
		Mae: but there’s also a lot of witches in it.
		Mae: and that makes me feel a tiny bit better.
		Bea: so the entire rust belt is just lousy with ghosts and witches?
		Mae: yeah but not all ghosts are bad, like… i mean… ugh.
		Mae: I don’t really know where I’m going with this. It’s been a long week.
		Bea: it’s fine.

	Mae: it’s everywhere, Bea-Bea-Q.
	Mae: all different kinds. Dry. Wet. Ultra.
-> and you can see like the world’s largest pierogi.
	Mae: or a museum of toy rocket ships
	Mae: or a factory where they make pretzels
	Mae: or a house that looks like a big chicken!
Bea: i could… ok let’s talk about it next year
Mae: i’ll start planning it now.
Bea: i thought you couldn’t leave home because of your… issue?
Mae: eh. You’re home enough.
Mae: i mean if we’re trapped here together
Mae: we might as well be trapped out there together.
