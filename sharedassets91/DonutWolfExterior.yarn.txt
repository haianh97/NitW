Gregg:{align=middle,locator=left}Yeah, the [shake=.1]DAH-DAH-DUUUUURGA[/shake] song?
Gregg: :|
Gregg:{locator=left,width=2}That song totally slays.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}You know how the one verse is like
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}"[wave]Deep cold[/wave]
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}[wave]darkest hole[/wave]

Gregg:{locator=left,width=1}Mae, we gotta.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=2}I'm too much for this town to handle
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}and Angus needs to be out of the sun as much as possible.
Mae:{locator=right,width=2}You know they have the sun in Bright Harbor, right?
Gregg:{locator=left,width=2}Mae, Bright Harbor has SO MANY Donut Wolfs.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=1}And punk shows.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=2}And people who aren't all straight gun nuts.
[[I think they have guns in Bright Harbor too.|Guns]]

Gregg:{locator=left,width=1}What kind of dream?
Mae:{locator=right,width=3}I was standing beside this well in the middle of some field.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}And it was all rainy and foggy.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=1.5}Mmhmm?
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}And I kept trying to back away from it
Mae:{locator=right,width=3}but every time I moved I slipped in the mud and ended up closer to the well.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=1}Crap.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}So I just had to stand still.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}Not move at all.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=1}That sounds freaky, dude.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}And the worst thing was
Mae:{locator=right,width=2}There was something deep down in the well.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}Looking up at me.
<<wait= 1>>
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}Thanks a lot dude, I'm totally gonna have nightmares now.

Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}What does your dad think about you leaving?
Gregg:{locator=left,width=1}I dunno.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}He's always too nice for me to know what he actually thinks.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}Hey Gregg?
Gregg:{locator=left,width=2}Yeah?
Mae:{locator=right,width=3}I'm going to be really sad when you go, asshole.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=2}I know.

Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}Mae, in my uncle's living room there are 8 different guns within reach of the couch.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}Wow, really?
Gregg:{locator=left,width=2}Yeah I think he's waiting for the FBI to come over the hill.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}Coming for his 8 guns?
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}He's our last line of defense.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}Hey remember that time in 9th grade when we made that bomb from off the internet?
Mae:{locator=right,width=2}The megaboom! You lost your eyebrows!
Gregg:{locator=left,width=2}A little more gasoline and I'd be wearing cool shades right now
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}to cover the horrifying ruin of my charred, empty eye sockets.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}Hey Gregg?
Gregg:{locator=left,width=2}Yeah?

Gregg:{locator=left,width=2}Yeah for real, dude.
Mae:{locator=right,width=3}I come back home and everyone's already made other plans.
Mae:{locator=right,width=3}I just want to hold on to something
Mae:{locator=right,width=3}and like...
Mae:{locator=right,width=3}Everything is ending, but I want more.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}Mae, we can't stay here forever.

Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5} Professor Lucius Von Gnomeo.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}How 'bout you, me and the professor go break some lightbulbs behind the Snack Falcon?
Mae:{locator=right,width=2}Yes? Obviously?
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}And Christine gave me a key for when I open,
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}Which means all you can slurp slushies, on me!
Mae:{locator=right,width=2}These are the nights I'll remember when I'm 60.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}Also I stole a bunch of lighter fluid so we can set something pretty big on fire!

Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}Mae, some things you just have to let go.
Mae:{locator=right,width=1}...
Mae:{locator=right,width=1}Yeah.
Gregg:{locator=left,width=3}Come on, let's go steal from my boss, who trusted me.

Mae: oh... oh no...
Mae: what happened?
Gregg: 4 got splattered by a semi truck
Gregg: some ran back up the hill
Gregg: but three made it over the median
Gregg: and across to the other side.
Gregg: and they just... stopped.
Gregg: and i got to the bottom of the hill, by the road
Gregg: which was like covered in sheep guts and parts
Mae: *urp*
Gregg: and we just looked at each other across the interstate.
Gregg: me waving my hands
Gregg: two ran back, got hit by *another* truck
    ->god.
    ->did the trucks stop?
        Gregg: THEY TOTALLY DIDN'T!
        Mae: that's probably illegal.
Gregg: but the other one
Gregg: he ran down the hill on the other side
Gregg: into the woods.
Gregg: and no one ever saw him again.
Mae: geez, dude.
    ->hey- your tattoo!
        Gregg: yeah.
        Mae: ha ha. I sleuthed the meaning.
