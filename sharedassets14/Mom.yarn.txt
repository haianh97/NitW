    Mom: who maybe don't have a lot of money
    Mom: and aren't used to getting offers like this.

    Mom: because the bank took advantage of us.
    Mom: and now they own the house, and we owe them more than it's worth.

    Mom: he’s got some blood on his right hand
    Mom: but no gun.
    Mae: huh.
    Mom: last thing- the dead guy has a scar on the back of his head.
	Mae: do you know the answer?
	Mom: well i don’t know if there’s *one* answer.
	Mom: it’s supposed to get ya thinkin’
	->about murder?
		Mom: can’t solve a murder without one!
	->you should have been a detective,
		Mom: yeah.
		Mom: i woulda loved that.
	Mae: ok so i have a question.
	->what kind of scar does the dead guy have?
		Mom: “a straight line, a few inches across, hidden under the hair”
		Mae: hmmm.
	->who’s the other guy in the room?
		Mom: “the suspect is clearly upper middle class”
        Mae: that’s not super helpful.
        Mom: maybe he like ski tripped him to death somehow.
        Mae: yeah he whacked him in the jacuzzi in his backyard.
	->what else is in the room?
		Mom: normal stuff. Refrigerator, microwave, silverware.
		Mae: knives?
		Mom: no knife wounds though.
		Mae: oh right.
	<<wait 3>>
    Mae: ok i think i got it!
	Mom: wow! Whatcha got???
	Mae: the guy in the room is a surgeon.
	Mae: he implanted a magnet in the dead guy’s skull
	Mae: that’s why he has that scar.
	Mae: then the suspect used a super magnet or something
    Mae: on the dead guy’s forehead
	Mae: which pulled the magnet out through the dude’s head.
	Mom: ha ha! That’s why he has blood on one hand!
	Mae: yup. And i bet the murder weapons are stuck to the fridge
	Mae: holding up a pic of Aunt Dottie.
	Mom: oh bravo, sweetie!
	Mae: thank you, thank you.
	Mom: we’d make quite a pair of investigators.
