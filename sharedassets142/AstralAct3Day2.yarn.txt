Mae: Hello?
<<close>>
<<wait 4>>
Mae: Can you talk?
CatGod: Yes.
Mae: For some reason, you’re the first thing here I’ve thought to talk to.
<<close>>
<<wait 4>>
Mae: Are you... god?
CatGod: No...
Mae: oh
<<close>>
<<wait 2>>
Mae: So,
CatGod: Seconds ago little creatures are coming
CatGod: and they are asking if I am god
CatGod: and I am asking what god is
CatGod: and they are telling me
CatGod: and I am not this god
CatGod: and this god is nowhere
->well, you can’t see god
	CatGod: you are seeing what you are wishing, little creature
->well, that’s where faith comes in i guess
	CatGod: little creatures are explaining faith
	CatGod: and moments ago is the beginning
	CatGod: and i am here then and here now
	CatGod: and there is nowhere for god to be hiding
Mae: ...
Mae: so what am i doing here?
CatGod: monstrous existence
Mae: no, i mean what am I doing *here*?
Mae: what are you? What are those other giant animals?
Mae: have i been seeing ghosts?
Mae: there were like bits of the world...
Mae: i think i was on a train, but it was like a town?
Mae: it’s all-
Mae: ugh. I lost it.
<<close>>
<<wait 2>>
Mae: Ok, so-
CatGod: A great beast is walking through the sands
CatGod: and they are climbing into the air
CatGod: and now they are making a tear
CatGod: and now they are gone
CatGod: and now you are here
->what?
->a... tear?
	CatGod: With their hooves
	CatGod: they are making a tear
CatGod: little creatures are wandering through the air
CatGod: and they are dragging in places and echoes of lives
CatGod: and they are asking me about god
Mae: my head hurts
CatGod: i am going to tell you something, little creature
CatGod: you are swimming further and further out to sea
CatGod: and beyond are things blind and terrible
CatGod: and i am showing you now

Mae: aaagh
Mae: oh god. oh god.
CatGod: they are blind, but they are seeing you
CatGod: and you are coming to them
CatGod: after this you are not returning here
CatGod: i am climbing into the air
CatGod: and closing the sky
->why?
	CatGod: I am tired of speaking with little creatures
	CatGod: I am tired of speaking of god
->closing the sky?
	CatGod: yes
Mae: ok...
CatGod: I will tell you a second thing
CatGod: There is a hole at the center of everything
CatGod: and it is always growing
CatGod: between the stars i am seeing it
CatGod: it is coming	
CatGod: and you are not escaping
CatGod: and the universe is forgetting you
CatGod: and the universe is being forgotten
CatGod: and there is nothing to remember it
CatGod: not even the things beyond
CatGod: and now there is only the hole
Mae: so... does anything mean anything?
CatGod: this is not a question worth answering
-> what about my home? What about my friends?
	CatGod: soon they are dying
	CatGod: soon they are rotting
-> what about trees in the fall? What about the leaves?
	CatGod: bare existence, meaning nothing
CatGod: you are atoms
//begin blurry fade to black//
CatGod: and your atoms are not caring if you are existing
CatGod: your atoms are monstrous existence
Mae: then why am I here goddammit? Why was i chosen to see all of this?
Mae: where is this going?
CatGod: little creature, you are not chosen
CatGod: there is no one to choose you
CatGod: this is going nowhere
CatGod: we are not meeting again
//fully black now//
CatGod: and the universe is forgetting you
CatGod: and I am remembering you
CatGod: but not because I am caring
CatGod: the beginning is moments ago
CatGod: the end is moments away
CatGod: there is no time to forget
CatGod: before all is forgotten
CatGod: goodbye, little creature
